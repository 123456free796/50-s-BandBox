Hi! You've downloaded the Beep Box source code! ^_^

All of the source code here is available under the MIT license. 

Probably the most useful thing you can do with this right now is to copy the 
beepbox.synth package into your Flash project, allowing you to play songs in 
your game that were designed in the Beep Box editor. These songs are much 
smaller in file size than equivalent MP3s, at the cost of the processing time 
required to generate the song in code. 

See the "SynthExample.as" in the src folder to see how to use it. If you're on 
a Mac with the free Flex SDK installed, you should be able to run the included 
compile scripts from the command line to compile Beep Box and the synth 
example.
