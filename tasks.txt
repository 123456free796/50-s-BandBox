√ loop control
√ rename note to pitch, tone to note. 
√ octave scroll dragging should just be one History change, and it would be nice if dragging sliders didn't generate a bunch of undo history events. Ooh, let's do it for transpose too.
√ merge undo history with browser history.
√ optimize song.toString using charCodes. rename song.toString to song.toBase64String.
√ rename "_on" to "_when". rename attack to envelope.
√ when undoing changes selected bar, track editor should scroll to display it.
√ If there's a drum note at the second-to-top slot, I can't add on to the top slot. Also, the whole snap-to-nearby-note-pitch thing makes less sense for drums anyway. 
√ octave scroll bar shouldn't show white highlight when mouseover if current channel is drums.
√ Let "back" and "escape" closed modal dialogs/prompts. 
√ copy and paste across tabs? (local storage?)
√ drum noise waves should be static, and generated on demand. (when play() is called, and at start of synth callback, check all drum instruments.) ensureDrumWavesExist()
√ "custom/harmonize" chorus setting. lock first chorus voice to first pitch, the second voice arpeggios remaining pitches.
√ move waves into Music structure.
√ the "period" variables are the wrong name for what they mean. In Song, rename "instruments" to "instrumentCount", and other similar properties.
√ add sixths and eighths rhythms.
√ custom number of channels, up to 6 melodic and 2 drums. 
	√ change song size prompt
	√ import base64, export base64, import json, export json, export midi

	√ in pattern editor, show all drum channels if appropriate preference is on.
	√ track editor scaling
	√ track colors based on channel type
	√ _defaultPinChannels was broken.
√ move Music to top, rename to Config.
√ drumFilter shouldn't have hardcoded dependence on drum wave index.
√ adjust json import to be backwards compatible with old names: romani, binary
√ when exporting to midi with custom harmony, use correct simultaneous notes.
√ new drum waves! :D (Thanks modded beepbox!)
√ the play button should also have move playhead buttons next to it.
√ responsive design layout. Okay, put play/edit/options/export on a horizontal line under loop editor, song settings below on left, and instrument settings below on right. 
√ max-height of pattern editor (and piano/scrollbar) should be less than 100vh.
√ the method for cycling patterns on a bar is inadequate on touchscreen... use select menu? also update instructions in index.html for changing patterns.
√ highlight note edge extensions on touch
√ midi channel export names should be in Config.
√ random infinite loops when opening new song?
√ when pattern is 0, show other channels anyway over black pattern editor.
√ faster tempos

MISC:
- I don't like how when you click the wave menu then use arrow keys to select drums the editor loses focus.
- pitch bends mixed with arpeggios don’t properly check min/max bounds
- can I improve the interaction for volume envelope dragging and pitch dragging? illustrate volume envelope dragging to make it less confusing. 
- Bring beepbox and openscores coding styles closer together. See html functions, Synth-vs-SongPlayer
- remember recent songs in cookies or local shared object.
- export mp3 and ogg?
- tooltips
- a way to pre-generate a javascript sound buffer.
- asynchronous export
- Make an embeddable song player and album player. (See below.) 
- document synth api
- disable canvas pixel blurring in high dpi? why doesn't it work yet? (or just replace piano/drums with svg)
- do audio worker threads work yet? Maybe feature-detect them? "AudioWorkerNode" vs "AudioWorkletNode"???

EMBEDDED PLAYER:
- put title in data format if provided. show "artist - title" in placeholder text. make sure it is sanitized for security. :)
- maybe instead of squashing notes really tiny, consider scrolling them instead.
- If you hold control or shift and click play, put "*" in storage instead, and allow anything to continue playing until it is replaced with a unique id again or manually paused. 
- It probably doesn't make sense to integrate licenses like creative commons into the data format: it would imply more authority than is actually possible. It is up to users to say how they want their songs to be used. However, there should be an option to disable the "Edit in BeepBox" link, which would turn on basic encryption.
- maybe add a download/export button? set default file title based on embedded title. (restricting character set appropriately)
- support both flash and js embedded players?
- should the author be able to set the default loop behavior?
- under the file menu make a "share" button that displays a link that can be copied easily on mobile. 
- the embed player itself should have a share button, for social media. which should link to a full page player instead of the editor?
- These icons at the bottom of the embed player should have tooltips. 
- maybe also make a full page song player, to link to from tweets when you don't want others to edit.
- add "Share" or "HTML Embed" button under export? or "File" menu. Include "title" and "author" fields.
- manifests to allow installing web app as mobile app. add note in instructions. add any new files to app.yaml
- allow copying the url from the share menu, so the app version can hide the url bar.
- sharing menu uses localSharedObject to remember your settings. same as editor volume?
- should I make cards for twitter/facebook/slack/discord etc? Wait I need https for that I think...
- make sure bots ignore embed.html

PLAYLIST EDITOR:
- button to add more songs to list extracted from urls
- update embed player to show all songs
- song rearranging
- song loop count
- song fade-in/out
- example songs on the website. Mario overworld? Tetris is basically public domain...
- when starting at a bar where all tones are at the end of the bar, go ahead and skip the beginning of the bar, up to maybe one beat before the first tone.
- put songs in browser history before/after pasting new songs.
- offsite album/playlist player, with scrolling notes. hashbang urls, bot indexable. 

AUTHENTICATION:
- show light "http://" or "http://www.beepbox.com/" in url fields while empty
- round trip to server auth. How are the link, iframe html, and twitter button presented?
- author, password, website
- non-editable songs in list from pre-published playlists
- key stretching, salt, at least partially on server
- cc license enforcement
- store author/password is localSO or cookie, if "remember me" is flagged
- flag to reveal password, otherwise show dots
- underline author name as URL in embed player
- "inspire me" button for passwords, shows prompt with a random button that gives you three-ish words, and requests that you personalize your password by adding some more words and punctuation to complete the thought. 
- main website should break out of iframe for security: http://usablelayout.com/articles/automatically-break-out-iframe

MAYBE:
- translation/localization
- Get in touch with ludum dare about linking to beepbox: http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/tools/
- get in touch with http://youcanmakevideogames.com/resources/music
- new preferences: follow playhead, play at load (on desktop)?
- multitouch?
- piano should still play when song is paused
- illustrate arpeggio texture on tones with multiple notes, striped fill
- @Gasparatus asked for a BPM display.
- custom cover art, color schemes in playlists and embed player.
- on linux chrome, select drop downs use same background color as select element, it's a bit too bright when focused.
- per-pattern drop down menu for instrument selection, prepopulated with common ones. 
- export fade in/out checkboxes
- derive song length from number of bars with non-zero patterns
- more “effect” keys like stutter, scratch, scrub, drag playhead, speedmult, whatever.
- detect vibrate switch
- circle of fifths display
- allow drums to be divided into shorter parts, crucial for songs like the mario overworld
- 5 parts per beat?
- double number of beat divisions
- it would be awesome to have a couple of modes where when you drag the playhead, it overrides the tempo of the song to match the motion of your mouse. In one mode it distorts the pitch like a DJ table, in the other it plays the normal pitch like SoundSPEAR.
- Distortion applying to blue and yellow channels
- Dim the column occupied by a tone to communicate mono voice?
- rename barpattern to pattern, bareditor to patterneditor, attack to envelope...
- snap to tone edges from other channels, to help making NES style harmonies. 
- new song setting: distortion, nonlinear mixing of channels...
- If mouse drags at least two beats closer to start than previous max, then enter precise mode where you can have any length. If flipping to backwards or <= doc.parts, reset out of precise mode. 
- compacting and concatenating songs!
- visual feedback when a note is played
- when on the same pitch as a tone in an adjacent part, and you're really close to it, and you drag horizontally, go ahead and drag that adjacent tone instead of creating a new one.
- options for timing offset
- phoneme filter option, imitate vowels and voiced consonants with IIR filters, fall back on noise channel for S, T, CH, SH, etc. 
- a facebook app to put songs in your profile
- preload some common tone shapes into the recentShape list. increment format number.
- make some button to bookmark the song in your browser
- Make a bunch of asserts, that the tones don't overlap, that the pins have the same duration as the tones, that the pins are in order, etc. And trace out the arguments to every change constructor and maybe even trace out the entire bar document data after every step.
