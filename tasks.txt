√ create public version number
√ reenable filter in one drop down menu

√ center waves on average amplitude to avoid pops after lowpass
√ move the playhead graphic gradually toward the next position. 
√ always fade out volume over last arpeggio
√ attack: hard, soft, slide. don't reset period when sliding!
√ octave scroll bar, with preference option to disable it
√ load old songs with octave offset, default pitch... 
√ bring back the old constant volume option, and make it the default for songs loaded with the old format.
√ widen the window to allow the "envelope" label
√ copy paste patterns
√ put the edit buttons in one menu. undo, copy/paste, clean slate, etc
√ copy and paste keyboard commands
√ perform dynamic range compression, increase base volume

NEXT VERSION:
- global volume control
- drum volume drop down menu
- drums get custom lowpass based on change rate? rebalance volume range too. base is too quiet, cymbal too loud.
- option: play on startup
- medium sustain filter, slower sharp filter...
- dedicated silent 0 pattern
- rename barpattern to pattern, bareditor to patterneditor, attack to envelope...
- wider beats/bar range, indicate recommended number 8 somehow?
- clip rect on pattern editor
- Dim the column occupied by a tone to communicate mono voice?
- volume pins, correctly moving pins when swingifying
- create portamento/slide, triggered by vertical dragging. The closer you are to a tone endpoint, the more bias towards changing tone length rather than portamento. How do I deal with combining portamento and arpeggio? I guess portamento is disabled if there's already a second note, unless it's in expert mode or a whole octave from the first note. 
- buttons to transpose up and down to the next valid note... careful of pitch bends and boundary conditions!
- tones that fade out completely shouldn't slide
- optimize those Math functions in Synth
- don't autoplay until URL fragment has been passed through
- make a svn-free copy of the synth source tree that you can download directly from google code hosting, a stable copy
- adjust drop down menu widths to fit the size of their contents, mostly so that they're not all the same size, to give you an extra visual cue to find the menu you're looking for

MORE FEATURES:
- distortion: light medium heavy, per channel distortion toggle
- tooltips
- double number of beat divisions
- illustrate arpeggio texture on tones with multiple notes
- phoneme filter option, imitate vowels and voiced consonants with IIR filters, fall back on noise channel for S, T, CH, SH, etc. 
- snap to tone edges from other channels, to help making NES style harmonies. 
- new song setting: distortion, nonlinear mixing of channels...
- save most recent song to localSO so that it doesn't accidentally get lost when window closes
- options for timing offset
- asynchronous wav export
- extend bar count and pattern count for advanced users. 
- a flag: "patterns share settings" or "unify channel settings" or whatever
- a way to convert a byte array to a first class Flash Sound object. 
- new preferences: follow playhead, autoplay on load?
- piano should still play when song is paused
- If mouse drags at least two beats closer to start than previous max, then enter precise mode where you can have any length. If flipping to backwards or <= doc.parts, reset out of precise mode. 
- visual feedback when a note is played
- make a non-editing embeddable player, in an iframe, with playhead tracking and all channels and no highlighting.
- 5 parts per beat?
- rapid document/fragment changes cause undefined state
- make some button to bookmark the song in your browser
- MIDI export
- preload some common tone shapes into the recentShape list. increment format number.
- Make a bunch of asserts, that the tones don't overlap, that the pins have the same duration as the tones, that the pins are in order, etc. And trace out the arguments to every change constructor and maybe even trace out the entire bar document data after every step. 
- Get in touch with wonderfl about supporting beepbox
- a facebook app to put songs in your profile
- web interface to share songs so that other visitors can see them. let users enter a name and a "password", which can just be an email address, which is used to generate a "retro" gravatar identicon. 
- automatic flash projector for offline version without causing the vvvvvv/machinarium file type issue.
