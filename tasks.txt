√ tweak hit detection on pitch bends so that it's a little tighter than a box
√ When the pitch bend changes the initial pitch, recalibrate all notes of the tone. 
√ don't let pitch bends escape the normal pitch range, especially with arpeggios. check both new arpeggios and new pitch bends.
√ tweak rendering of pitch bends so that they don't become tiny threads. 
√ volume pins
√ volume dragging doesn't seem to be relative to previous volume
√ dragging pitch bend off the side of the editor causes instability

NEXT VERSION:
- copy the volume pin structure for future tones, on a per channel basis.
- reset default tone shape when cleaning slate
- disable volume control when creating new tones with horizontal dragging. 
- dragging horizontally should drag the pins, not just the tone endpoints. 
- correctly move pins when swingifying, etc.
- buttons to transpose up and down to the next valid note... careful of pitch bends and boundary conditions!
- tones that fade out volume completely shouldn't slide to next tone
- attack transitions that slide should let the decay filter smoothly rise again to better approximate strings/violin
- group pattern count, bar count, and beats/bar into a modal window. 
- Benchmark synthesized vs precomputed noise. Precomputed would allow you to select non chip tune style noise. 
- can I make the "choir" option feel more natural?
- per-pattern drop down menu for instrument selection, prepopulated with common ones. 
- volume scaling from chorus effect: Synchronized waves are louder than waves that are almost but not quite the same frequency. Ratio: square root of two!
- drums get custom lowpass based on change rate? rebalance volume range too. bass is too quiet, cymbal too loud.
- option: autoplay on startup
- don't autoplay until URL fragment has been passed through
- medium sustain filter, slower sharp filter...
- dedicated silent 0 pattern
- Dim the column occupied by a tone to communicate mono voice?
- make a svn-free copy of the synth source tree that you can download directly from google code hosting, a stable copy

MORE FEATURES:
- when on the same pitch as a tone in an adjacent part, and you're really close to it, and you drag horizontally, go ahead and drag that adjacent tone instead of creating a new one.
- Distortion applying to green and yellow channels
- Reverb
- optimize those Math functions in Synth
- adjust drop down menu widths to fit the size of their contents, mostly so that they're not all the same size, to give you an extra visual cue to find the menu you're looking for
- rename barpattern to pattern, bareditor to patterneditor, attack to envelope...
- make play and volume controls prettier
- convert pattern editor from mxml to a sprite
- distortion: light medium heavy, per channel distortion toggle
- tooltips
- double number of beat divisions
- illustrate arpeggio texture on tones with multiple notes
- phoneme filter option, imitate vowels and voiced consonants with IIR filters, fall back on noise channel for S, T, CH, SH, etc. 
- snap to tone edges from other channels, to help making NES style harmonies. 
- new song setting: distortion, nonlinear mixing of channels...
- save most recent song to localSO so that it doesn't accidentally get lost when window closes
- options for timing offset
- asynchronous wav export
- extend bar count and pattern count for advanced users. 
- a flag: "patterns share settings" or "unify channel settings" or whatever
- a way to convert a byte array to a first class Flash Sound object. 
- new preferences: follow playhead, autoplay on load?
- piano should still play when song is paused
- If mouse drags at least two beats closer to start than previous max, then enter precise mode where you can have any length. If flipping to backwards or <= doc.parts, reset out of precise mode. 
- visual feedback when a note is played
- make a non-editing embeddable player, in an iframe, with playhead tracking and all channels and no highlighting.
- 5 parts per beat?
- rapid document/fragment changes cause undefined state
- make some button to bookmark the song in your browser
- MIDI export
- preload some common tone shapes into the recentShape list. increment format number.
- Make a bunch of asserts, that the tones don't overlap, that the pins have the same duration as the tones, that the pins are in order, etc. And trace out the arguments to every change constructor and maybe even trace out the entire bar document data after every step. 
- Get in touch with wonderfl about supporting beepbox
- get in touch with http://youcanmakevideogames.com/resources/music
- a facebook app to put songs in your profile
- web interface to share songs so that other visitors can see them. let users enter a name and a "password", which can just be an email address, which is used to generate a "retro" gravatar identicon. 
- automatic flash projector for offline version without causing the vvvvvv/machinarium file type issue.
