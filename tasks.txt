√ don't let pitch bends escape the normal pitch range, especially with arpeggios. check both new arpeggios and new pitch bends.
√ tweak rendering of pitch bends so that they don't become tiny threads. 
√ volume pins
√ volume dragging doesn't seem to be relative to previous volume
√ dragging pitch bend off the side of the editor causes instability
√ copy the volume pin structure for future tones, on a per channel basis.
√ disable volume control when creating new tones with horizontal dragging. 
√ reset default tone shape when cleaning slate
√ dragging horizontally should drag the pins, not just the tone endpoints.

√ when shrinking bar count, make sure to bound loop, barScrollPos, playhead, etc
√ use customized bar count, create GUI for scrolling bars somehow. 
√ empty patterns get special 1-bit treatment
√ serialize pattern instruments
√ Benchmark synthesized vs precomputed noise. Precomputed would allow you to select non chip tune style noise. 
√ rebalance drum volume range. bass is too quiet, cymbal too loud.
√ each drum wave gets volume scale
√ don't autoplay until URL fragment has been passed through
√ drums get custom lowpass based on change rate
√ can drums use the other envelope/slide options?
√ tones that fade out volume completely shouldn't slide to next tone
√ attack transitions that slide should let the decay filter smoothly rise again to better approximate strings/violin. also repeated notes shouldn't fade out automatically. 
√ volume scaling from chorus effect: Synchronized waves are louder than waves that are almost but not quite the same frequency. Ratio: square root of two!
√ medium sustain filter, slower sharp filter...

NEXT VERSION:
- rapid document/fragment changes due to undo cause undefined state
- make a non-editing embeddable player, in an iframe, with playhead tracking and all channels and no highlighting. Gravatar-like thing.
- per-pattern drop down menu for instrument selection, prepopulated with common ones. 
- octave dragging should just be one History change. 
- asynchronous wav export
- buttons to transpose up and down to the next valid note... careful of pitch bends and boundary conditions!
- move "song settings" section down, and fit a "pattern settings" between that and the "instrument settings". The pattern has a colored number and the instrument has a colored letter in the title, if there are at least two instruments.
- tooltips
- make a svn-free copy of the synth source tree that you can download directly from google code hosting, a stable copy
- new preferences: follow playhead, autoplay on load?
- example songs on the website. Mario overworld?
- compacting and concatenating songs!

NEXT VERSION:
- web interface to share songs so that other visitors can see them onsite.
- Distortion applying to green and yellow channels
- Reverb
- optimize those Math functions in Synth
- Dim the column occupied by a tone to communicate mono voice?
- wav export dialog lets you toggle intro, loop count, fade out or outro...
- rename barpattern to pattern, bareditor to patterneditor, attack to envelope...
- snap to tone edges from other channels, to help making NES style harmonies. 
- new song setting: distortion, nonlinear mixing of channels...
- save most recent song to localSO so that it doesn't accidentally get lost when window closes
- If mouse drags at least two beats closer to start than previous max, then enter precise mode where you can have any length. If flipping to backwards or <= doc.parts, reset out of precise mode. 

MORE FEATURES:
- a way to convert a byte array to a first class Flash Sound object. 
- Get in touch with wonderfl about supporting beepbox
- Get in touch with ludum dare about linking to beepbox: http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/tools/
- get in touch with http://youcanmakevideogames.com/resources/music
- when on the same pitch as a tone in an adjacent part, and you're really close to it, and you drag horizontally, go ahead and drag that adjacent tone instead of creating a new one.
- piano should still play when song is paused
- check to see if the drum frequency range could be usefully extended
- when holding down left or right arrow, stop at end of song until release and repress
- when pasting into the debug text field, re select the text after parsing.
- make play and volume controls prettier
- illustrate arpeggio texture on tones with multiple notes
- visual feedback when a note is played
- make the static file handler cache expiration longer than 10 minutes.

MAYBE:
- options for timing offset
- phoneme filter option, imitate vowels and voiced consonants with IIR filters, fall back on noise channel for S, T, CH, SH, etc. 
- adjust drop down menu widths to fit the size of their contents, mostly so that they're not all the same size, to give you an extra visual cue to find the menu you're looking for
- a facebook app to put songs in your profile
- automatic flash projector for offline version without causing the vvvvvv/machinarium file type issue.
- double number of beat divisions
- preload some common tone shapes into the recentShape list. increment format number.
- MIDI export
- 5 parts per beat?
- dedicated silent 0 pattern
- make some button to bookmark the song in your browser
- Make a bunch of asserts, that the tones don't overlap, that the pins have the same duration as the tones, that the pins are in order, etc. And trace out the arguments to every change constructor and maybe even trace out the entire bar document data after every step.
