- example songs on the website. Mario overworld?
- rapid document/fragment changes due to undo cause undefined state
- fix it so that the browser back button isn't useless. save state before and after pasting new song. 
- when starting at a bar where all tones are at the end of the bar, go ahead and skip the beginning of the bar, up to maybe one beat before the first tone.

NEXT VERSION:
- allow drums to be divided into shorter parts, crucial for songs like the mario overworld
- it would be awesome to have a couple of modes where when you drag the playhead, it overrides the tempo of the song to match the motion of your mouse. In one mode it distorts the pitch like a DJ table, in the other it plays the normal pitch like SoundSPEAR.
- Distortion applying to green and yellow channels
- Reverb
- optimize those Math functions in Synth
- Dim the column occupied by a tone to communicate mono voice?
- rename barpattern to pattern, bareditor to patterneditor, attack to envelope...

- save most recent song to localSO so that it doesn't accidentally get lost when window closes

- when pasting into the debug text field, re select the text after parsing.
- make play and volume controls prettier
- illustrate arpeggio texture on tones with multiple notes
- visual feedback when a note is played
- make the static file handler cache expiration longer than 10 minutes.

MAYBE:
- when on the same pitch as a tone in an adjacent part, and you're really close to it, and you drag horizontally, go ahead and drag that adjacent tone instead of creating a new one.
- options for timing offset
- phoneme filter option, imitate vowels and voiced consonants with IIR filters, fall back on noise channel for S, T, CH, SH, etc.

- a facebook app to put songs in your profile
- automatic flash projector for offline version without causing the vvvvvv/machinarium file type issue.
- double number of beat divisions
- preload some common tone shapes into the recentShape list. increment format number.
